## 📝 Changelog

### Version 1.2.3 (2025-11-02)

**Configuration Stability, Boot Sequence & WiFi Stability Improvements**

This update fixes critical bugs in configuration management, boot sequence, and WiFi reconnection stability for PlatformIO builds.

#### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

**1. Configuration Checksum Infinite Loop Fixed**
- Resolved infinite loop when EEPROM configuration has checksum mismatch
  - When corrupted EEPROM data was detected, the code recursively called `loadConfiguration()`
  - This caused the same corrupted data to be read again, finding the same checksum mismatch
  - System would hang or repeatedly print error messages without recovery
  - **Solution**: Replace recursive call with direct default initialization
  - Configuration now properly resets to defaults and saves to EEPROM on checksum error
  - System recovers gracefully from corrupted configuration data

**2. Boot Sequence Case Statements Restored**
- Fixed compilation error: "break statement not within loop or switch"
  - Automated sed operations accidentally deleted case statements (14, 16, 17)
  - Restored all missing case declarations and code blocks
  - All 28 boot sequence steps (0-27) now present and functional

**3. Missing Variable Declaration Fixed**
- Fixed compilation error: "'brightRing' was not declared in this scope"
  - Added missing `brightRing` variable in boot sequence case 19
  - Variable declaration: `uint32_t brightRing = Adafruit_NeoPixel::Color(90, 120, 150);`
  - Consistent with other rotating ring effect cases (20, 21, 22)

**4. PWM Channel Conflicts Fixed (Pins 5-8)** ⭐ NEW
- Resolved "Pin X is already attached to LEDC" errors during servo initialization
  - **Problem**: Servos were re-attached without detaching first, causing PWM channel conflicts
  - **Symptoms**: Error messages like `[ESP32PWM.cpp:319] ERROR PWM channel failed to configure on pin 5!`
  - **Solution**: Added `servo.detach()` checks before `servo.attach()` in `initializeServos()`
  - Prevents LEDC channel conflicts during reinitialization or WiFi reconnection

**5. RMT TX Light-Sleep Issue Fixed (Pin 3)** ⭐ NEW
- Resolved NeoPixel RMT errors: "not able to power down in light sleep"
  - **Problem**: WiFi power-save mode conflicted with NeoPixel RMT driver
  - **Symptoms**: `[esp32-hal-rmt.c:548] RMT TX Initialization error` and NeoPixel flickering
  - **Solution**: Disabled WiFi sleep mode with `WiFi.setSleep(false)` in all WiFi modes
  - Prevents Light Sleep conflicts between WiFi and WS2812/NeoPixel RMT channels

**6. WiFi Reconnect Crash Fixed** ⭐ NEW
- Resolved FreeRTOS assertion crash during WiFi reconnection
  - **Problem**: Race condition between WiFi tasks and Web Server during reconnection
  - **Symptoms**: `assert failed: vTaskPriorityDisinheritAfterTimeout tasks.c:5267` followed by reboot
  - **Root Cause**: Web server and MDNS were not properly stopped before WiFi disconnect
  - **Solution**:
    - Added `server.stop()` before `WiFi.disconnect()`
    - Added `MDNS.end()` to properly clean up MDNS service
    - Increased cleanup delay from 500ms to 1000ms
    - Changed to `WiFi.disconnect(true)` for complete WiFi shutdown
  - WiFi reconnect via serial command now stable and reliable

**7. WiFi Status Check Race Conditions Fixed** ⭐ NEW
- Improved WiFi status monitoring to prevent task conflicts
  - Added `WL_NO_SHIELD` validation before accessing WiFi status
  - Increased status update interval from 2 seconds to 5 seconds
  - Prevents concurrent WiFi API calls that could cause task priority issues
  - More reliable WiFi connection state tracking

#### ⚡ Improvements

**8. Boot Sequence Messages Made Informative**
- Reduced 14 repetitive "Boot:" messages to 5 descriptive messages
- Clear indication of boot progress at key milestones:
  - "Boot: Initializing eye awakening sequence..."
  - "Boot: Ring LED activation..."
  - "Boot: Eyes at full power - Ice Blue activated"
  - "Boot: Checking audio system..."
  - "Boot: Centering servos..."
- 64% reduction in boot log spam (14 → 5 messages)
- Easier debugging when boot hangs at specific step

**9. WiFi Settings Persistence & EEPROM Structure Padding** ⭐ NEW
- **Root Cause Discovered**: Structure padding bytes causing checksum mismatches
  - **Problem**: C compiler inserts padding bytes for memory alignment (e.g., 3 bytes after `uint8_t magic`)
  - **Impact**: Uninitialized padding bytes caused random checksum values on every boot
  - **Symptoms**: WiFi settings appeared to save but were lost after reboot
  - **Evidence**: Boot logs showed mismatched checksums (e.g., `0xFFFF351C` vs `0x00032FDC`)
  - **Intermittent Nature**: "teilweise nicht bei jedem reset sichtbar" - padding bytes had random values
- **Solution**: Added `__attribute__((packed))` to all EEPROM structures
  - `struct __attribute__((packed)) IRButton { ... };`
  - `struct __attribute__((packed)) Profile { ... };`
  - `struct __attribute__((packed)) ConfigData { ... };`
  - Eliminates all padding bytes, ensuring consistent memory layout
- **EEPROM Commit Improvements**:
  - Added verification by reading back after write
  - Implemented automatic retry mechanism on verification failure
  - Added 100ms delay after `EEPROM.commit()` to ensure flash write completion
  - Enhanced `saveConfiguration()` with detailed logging and error detection
- **Result**: WiFi credentials and all settings now persist reliably across reboots

**10. Quote-Aware Parser for WiFi/AP Commands** ⭐ NEW
- **Problem**: SSIDs or passwords with spaces couldn't be configured
  - Example: User's SSID "HONOR Magoc V2" was split into 3 arguments
  - Simple space-based parser treated each word as separate parameter
- **Solution**: Implemented smart quote-aware parser
  - Supports both quoted strings (`"My SSID"`) and unquoted strings (`MySSID`)
  - Handles multiple arguments with mixed quoting
  - Parser logic:
    ```cpp
    if (params[i] == '"') {
      // Read until closing quote
      args[argCount++] = params.substring(startIdx, endIdx);
    } else {
      // Read until next space
      args[argCount++] = params.substring(startIdx, endIdx);
    }
    ```
- **Usage Examples**:
  - `wifi set "HONOR Magoc V2" "my password"` - Both with spaces
  - `wifi set MySSID "password with spaces"` - Mixed
  - `ap set "My K2SO" MyPassword123` - Mixed
- **Documentation**: All WiFi/AP examples updated to show quote syntax

**11. LED Eye Configuration Persistence** ⭐ NEW
- **Problem**: LED eye version changes (7led/13led) didn't persist after reboot
  - User would set `led eye 13led`, but after restart, it reverted to default
  - Manual `save` command was required to persist the setting
- **Solution**: Added automatic `smartSaveToEEPROM()` after eye version changes
  - Modified LED eye command handler in `handlers.cpp`
  - Now automatically saves to EEPROM when switching between 7-LED and 13-LED configurations
  - Consistent with other configuration commands that auto-save
- **Implementation**:
  ```cpp
  if (eyeVersion == "7led") {
    setEyeHardwareVersion(EYE_VERSION_7LED);
    smartSaveToEEPROM();  // Auto-save to EEPROM
  } else if (eyeVersion == "13led") {
    setEyeHardwareVersion(EYE_VERSION_13LED);
    smartSaveToEEPROM();  // Auto-save to EEPROM
  }
  ```
- **Result**: Eye configuration now persists across reboots without manual save

#### 🧹 Code Quality Improvements

**12. Legacy DetailBlinker Code Removed**
- **Cleanup**: Removed deprecated GPIO-based detail LED system
  - Old system used 2 simple GPIO LEDs (pins 10, 13) with basic on/off blinking
  - New system uses WS2812 addressable LED strip with full color control
  - Legacy code was causing confusion and bloating the codebase
- **Files Modified**:
  - `config.h`: Removed `DetailBlinker` struct definition
  - `globals.h`: Removed `blinkers[2]` and `DETAIL_LED_PINS[2]` declarations
  - `handlers.h`: Removed `initializeDetailBlinkers()` and `updateDetailBlinkers()` function declarations
  - `handlers.cpp`: Removed empty `updateDetailBlinkers()` function
  - `K_2SO_DroidLogicMotion_v1.2.3.ino`: Removed global variables and initialization function
- **Code Reduction**: Removed 39 lines of dead code
- **Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with only the active WS2812 system

#### ⚠️ When These Fixes Apply

### 3. Serial Commands (115200 baud)

#### Basic Commands:

help          # Show complete command reference
status        # Display system information
config        # Show current configuration
save          # Save settings to EEPROM
reset         # Restart system

#### WiFi Configuration (v1.2.0+):

wifi set "ssid" "password"  # Configure WiFi credentials (saves to EEPROM, quotes for spaces)
wifi show                   # Display current WiFi settings and connection status
wifi reset                  # Clear WiFi configuration (requires confirmation)
wifi reconnect              # Reconnect to WiFi with current settings

**Examples:**
```
wifi set "MyHomeNetwork" "SuperSecret123"
wifi set "HONOR Magoc V2" "my password"  # With spaces
wifi show
wifi reconnect
```

**Notes:**
- WiFi credentials stored in EEPROM persist across reboots
- EEPROM configuration takes priority over config.h
- Passwords are masked when displayed
- Use 'wifi reset' to return to config.h settings

#### Access Point (AP) Mode Configuration (v1.2.0+):

When WiFi connection fails, K-2SO can automatically create its own WiFi access point for direct connection.

ap set "ssid" "password"    # Configure custom AP credentials (password min 8 chars, quotes for spaces)
ap show                     # Display current AP settings and status
ap reset                    # Reset to default AP settings (K2SO-XXXXXX)
ap enable                   # Enable AP mode fallback (auto-starts when WiFi fails)
ap disable                  # Disable AP mode fallback
ap start                    # Start AP mode immediately

**Examples:**
```
ap set "K2SO-Droid" "MyPassword123"
ap set "My K2SO" "password with spaces"  # With spaces
ap enable
ap show
ap start
```

**Default AP Settings:**
- **SSID**: `K2SO-XXXXXX` (where XXXXXX is from device MAC address)
- **Password**: `k2so2024` (configurable in config.h)
- **IP Address**: `192.168.4.1` (standard ESP32 AP address)

**How AP Mode Works:**
1. K-2SO attempts to connect to configured WiFi network
2. If connection fails and AP mode is enabled (`ap enable`), it automatically starts an access point
3. Connect your phone/computer to the K2SO WiFi network
4. Access web interface at `http://192.168.4.1`
5. Configure WiFi settings via web interface or serial commands
6. Restart to connect to your WiFi network

**Notes:**
- AP credentials stored in EEPROM persist across reboots
- AP mode is disabled by default - use `ap enable` to activate fallback
- Minimum password length: 8 characters (WPA2 requirement)
- Web interface fully functional in both WiFi and AP modes
- Use `ap disable` to prevent automatic AP fallback

#### Voice Assistant Control (Google Home, Alexa, Siri) (v1.2.0+):

## 🌟 New in Version 1.1.0

### Advanced Eye Animation Modes

Version 1.1.0 introduces 8 new animation modes for enhanced visual effects:

#### Circle-Eye Special Effects (13-LED Eyes Only)

The 13-LED eye configuration features a center LED (LED 0) surrounded by a 12-LED ring (LEDs 1-12), enabling sophisticated circular animation patterns:

**Iris Mode** (`led mode iris`)
- Ring LEDs pulse smoothly while center LED stays static
- Creates an iris dilation effect
- Ideal for scanning or focusing behaviors

**Targeting Mode** (`led mode targeting`)
- 4-point crosshair rotates around the ring
- Center LED blinks in sync
- Perfect for targeting or lock-on effects

**Ring Scanner** (`led mode ring_scanner`)
- Scanner effect isolated to the ring only
- Center LED remains constantly on
- Provides a unique scanning pattern

**Spiral Mode** (`led mode spiral`)
- LEDs light up sequentially from outside to inside
- Creates a spiral animation effect
- Great for boot sequences or transitions

**Focus Mode** (`led mode focus`)
- Ring LEDs blink while center stays on
- Simulates focusing or concentration
- Useful for attention-drawing moments

**Radar Mode** (`led mode radar`)
- Smooth radar sweep around the ring
- 6-LED fade trail for realistic effect
- Center LED stays dimly lit

#### Synchronized Effects (All Eye Configurations)

**Heartbeat Mode** (`led mode heartbeat`)
- Synchronized double-pulse pattern (lub-dub)
- Both eyes pulse together
- 1.2-second cycle with realistic timing
- Creates organic, living appearance

**Alarm Mode** (`led mode alarm`)
- Rapid red/white alternating flash
- Both eyes synchronized
- High-visibility alert pattern
- 150ms flash interval

### Detail LED Strip System

The Detail LED system now uses addressable WS2812 LEDs with 5 animation patterns:

**Blink Pattern** (`detail pattern blink`)
- Standard on/off blinking
- Adjustable speed and brightness
- All active LEDs blink in unison

**Fade Pattern** (`detail pattern fade`)
- Smooth fade in/out effect
- Gentle breathing animation
- Configurable fade speed

**Chase Pattern** (`detail pattern chase`)
- Sequential lighting along the strip
- Creates motion illusion
- Speed adjustable via timing

**Pulse Pattern** (`detail pattern pulse`)
- Synchronized pulsing
- All LEDs breathe together
- Smooth sine wave modulation

**Random Pattern** (`detail pattern random`)
- Random LED activation
- Creates organic blinking effect
- Individual LED randomization

### Enhanced Web Interface

The web interface now includes a dedicated Detail LED Control section:

- **LED Count Slider**: Adjust active LED count (1-8) in real-time
- **Brightness Control**: Independent brightness control for detail LEDs
- **Pattern Buttons**: Quick access to all 5 animation patterns
- **On/Off Toggle**: Enable/disable detail LEDs without losing settings

### Eye Hardware Configuration

Eyes can now be configured for two hardware variants:

**7-LED Configuration** (`led eye 7led`)
- Traditional 7-LED strip (LEDs 0-6)
- Compatible with all standard animation modes
- Backward compatible with previous builds

**13-LED Configuration** (`led eye 13led`) - Default
- Center LED (LED 0) + 12-LED ring (LEDs 1-12)
- Enables all Circle-Eye special effects
- Recommended for new builds
- Provides maximum animation variety

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Hardware Issues

#### LEDs Not Working
- ✅ Check power supply (5V, adequate current)
- ✅ Verify NeoPixel pin connections (GP3, GP4)
- ✅ Test with simple colors: `led color 255 0 0`
- ✅ Check if pixels are damaged (try different LED count)

#### Servos Not Moving  
- ✅ Verify 5V power supply (minimum 3A)
- ✅ Check servo pin connections (GP5-GP8)
- ✅ Test individual servos: `servo test all`
- ✅ Calibrate center positions if binding occurs

#### Audio Not Working
- ✅ Verify DFPlayer wiring (GP11→TX, GP12→RX)
- ✅ Check SD card format (FAT32) and file structure
- ✅ Ensure MP3 files are in correct folders (01/, 02/, etc.)
- ✅ Test volume: `sound volume 25`
- ✅ Check amplifier power and speaker connections

#### IR Remote Not Responding
- ✅ Verify IR receiver connection (GP9)
- ✅ Program remote: type `learn` in Serial Monitor
- ✅ Test scanner mode: type `scan`
- ✅ Check IR codes: type `show`

### Software Issues

#### Configuration Checksum Mismatch (Fixed in v1.2.3)

**Symptom:** "Configuration checksum mismatch, reloading defaults" message appears repeatedly, or system hangs during boot

**Cause:** EEPROM configuration data is corrupted (power loss during write, memory corruption, or version incompatibility)

**Solution (Automatic in v1.2.3):**
- System automatically detects corrupted configuration
- Resets all settings to factory defaults
- Saves clean configuration to EEPROM
- System boots normally without user intervention

**Manual Recovery (if needed):**
```

reset                       # Restart system (will auto-recover)
config                      # Verify configuration loaded correctly
save                        # Force save current configuration
```

**Prevention:**
- Avoid unplugging power during configuration save operations
- Use `save` command only when necessary
- Keep firmware up to date for improved EEPROM management

**Verification:**
- Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
- Look for "Defaults loaded and saved after checksum mismatch" message
- System should continue booting normally
- All settings reset to defaults (reconfigure as needed)

#### ESP32-S3 Boot Hanging (Fixed in v1.2.2)

**Symptom:** ESP32-S3 hangs during boot, no serial output, system doesn't start

**Solution (PlatformIO - Automatic):**
```bash
pio run -t upload          # USB CDC configured automatically
```

**Solution (Arduino IDE - Manual):**
1. Tools → Board → "ESP32S3 Dev Module"
2. **Tools → USB CDC On Boot → "Enabled"** ⚠️ CRITICAL!
3. Tools → USB Mode → "Hardware CDC and JTAG"
4. Re-upload the sketch

**Verification:**
- Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
- Press Reset button on ESP32-S3
- You should see boot messages within 2-3 seconds
- If still no output: Check USB cable and try different USB port

**See PLATFORMIO_FIX.md for detailed troubleshooting guide**

#### Compilation Errors
- ✅ Verify ESP32 board package (3.3.1+)
- ✅ Install all required libraries
- ✅ Select "ESP32S3 Dev Module" as board
- ✅ Check for library version conflicts
- ✅ **PlatformIO users:** Run `pio lib install` to install dependencies

#### WiFi Connection Problems & Crashes (Fixed in v1.2.3) ⭐ NEW

**Symptom 1: System crashes with "assert failed: vTaskPriorityDisinheritAfterTimeout"**
```
assert failed: vTaskPriorityDisinheritAfterTimeout tasks.c:5267
Backtrace: 0x4037738d:0x3fcad2b0 ...
Rebooting...
```

**Cause:** Race condition between WiFi tasks and Web Server during reconnection

**Solution (Fixed in v1.2.3):**
- Upgrade to v1.2.3 for automatic fix
- WiFi reconnection now properly stops web server and MDNS before disconnect
- Includes proper cleanup delays to prevent FreeRTOS task conflicts

**Verification:**
```
wifi reconnect              # Should reconnect without crash
```

---

**Symptom 2: WiFi settings lost after reboot** ⭐ FIXED IN v1.2.3

**Previous Symptom:**
```
Configuration checksum mismatch!
Stored checksum: 0xFFFF351C, Calculated checksum: 0x00032FDC
WiFi not configured
```

**Root Cause (Discovered & Fixed):**
- **Structure padding bytes** were causing checksum mismatches
- C compiler inserts padding bytes for memory alignment (e.g., 3 bytes after `uint8_t magic`)
- These uninitialized padding bytes had random values on each boot
- Checksums calculated differently each time, causing "checksum mismatch"
- Settings appeared saved but were rejected as corrupted on reboot
- **Intermittent nature**: Sometimes worked, sometimes didn't (depending on random padding values)

**Solution (Implemented in v1.2.3):**
1. **Structure Packing**: Added `__attribute__((packed))` to all EEPROM structures
   - Eliminates padding bytes completely
   - Ensures consistent memory layout
2. **EEPROM Verification**: Added read-back verification after write
   - Automatically retries on verification failure
   - 100ms delay after `EEPROM.commit()` for flash write completion
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed debug output shows checksums and verification status

**How to Configure WiFi:**
```
wifi set "ssid" "password"         # Configure WiFi (quotes for spaces)
wifi set "HONOR Magoc V2" "pass"   # Example with spaces
wifi show                          # Verify settings saved
reset                              # Reboot to test persistence
wifi show                          # Should show same settings after reboot
```

**Verification:**
- No more "Configuration checksum mismatch" messages on boot
- Settings persist reliably after reboot/power cycle
- Serial output shows: "✓ EEPROM verification PASSED"
- Check with `wifi show` command after reboot

---

**General WiFi Issues:**
- ✅ Update credentials in config.h OR use serial `wifi set` command
- ✅ Check network availability and password
- ✅ Verify 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- ✅ Check router compatibility and firewall settings
- ✅ **v1.2.3:** WiFi sleep mode automatically disabled to prevent RMT conflicts

#### Serial Communication Issues
- ✅ Set baud rate to 115200
- ✅ Select correct COM port
- ✅ Check USB cable quality
- ✅ Press EN button if ESP32 doesn't respond

---

#### PWM Channel Conflicts (Fixed in v1.2.3) ⭐ NEW

**Symptom:** Error messages during boot or WiFi reconnection:
```
[ESP32PWM.cpp:319] attachPin(): [ESP32PWM] ERROR PWM channel failed to configure on pin 5!
[esp32-hal-ledc.c:111] ledcAttachChannel(): Pin 5 is already attached to LEDC (channel 0, resolution 10)
```

**Cause:** Servos were re-attached without detaching first, causing LEDC PWM channel conflicts

**Solution (Fixed in v1.2.3):**
- Upgrade to v1.2.3 for automatic fix
- Servo initialization now checks for existing attachments before re-attaching
- Prevents PWM channel conflicts during reinitialization

**Affected Pins:** GP5, GP6, GP7, GP8 (Eye Pan/Tilt, Head Pan/Tilt servos)

**Verification:**
- Boot messages should no longer show PWM/LEDC errors
- Servos initialize correctly without error messages

---

#### NeoPixel RMT Errors (Fixed in v1.2.3) ⭐ NEW

**Symptom:** NeoPixel initialization errors and flickering LEDs:
```
E (250) rmt: rmt_new_tx_channel(269): not able to power down in light sleep
[esp32-hal-rmt.c:548] rmtInit(): GPIO 3 - RMT TX Initialization error.
[esp.c:82] espShow(): Failed to init RMT TX mode on pin 3
```

**Cause:** WiFi power-save mode (Light Sleep) conflicts with NeoPixel RMT driver

**Solution (Fixed in v1.2.3):**
- Upgrade to v1.2.3 for automatic fix
- WiFi sleep mode automatically disabled with `WiFi.setSleep(false)`
- Prevents conflicts between WiFi power management and WS2812/NeoPixel RMT channels

**Affected Pins:** GP3, GP4 (Left/Right Eye NeoPixels), GP10 (Detail LED strip), GP21 (Status LED)

**Verification:**
- No RMT error messages during boot
- NeoPixels initialize and animate smoothly
- Status LED and Detail LEDs work correctly

**Background:**
- ESP32-S3 RMT (Remote Control) peripheral is used for precise WS2812 timing
- WiFi Light Sleep mode can interfere with RMT timing requirements
- Disabling WiFi sleep ensures stable NeoPixel operation
